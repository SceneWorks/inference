//! Krea 2 **pose-ControlNet control branch** — the sc-8460 spike (epic 8459).
//!
//! A ControlNet-style trainable side branch over the Krea 2 single-stream DiT: the first `N`
//! (default 7 of 28) single-stream blocks are **copied** into a fully trainable branch
//! ([`ControlBranch`]), driven by the same frozen pre-main front-end the base uses. The branch input
//! is the base's joint `[ctx; img]` sequence with the **control latent embedding** (the VAE-encoded
//! pose skeleton, patch-embedded through the *frozen* base `img_in` —
//! [`KreaTrainDit::embed_latent`]) added onto the image-token slice. After each branch block `i` a
//! **zero-initialized** output projection produces a per-block residual that is added (scaled by
//! `control_scale`) onto the frozen main stream's **image tokens** entering main block `i` — so at
//! step 0 the branch is an exact identity over the base model (the ControlNet zero-init property).
//!
//! Everything in the branch trains (attention, gate, SwiGLU, norms, modulation table, and the output
//! projections); the entire base (DiT + text encoder + VAE) stays frozen. The branch reuses the
//! composable (differentiable) ops of [`crate::train_dit`] — the fused `softmax_last_dim` /
//! `ops::rms_norm` kernels have no backward.
//!
//! **Dtype.** Branch matmul weights live in a configurable dtype (bf16 default — full f32 master
//! weights for a ~3B-param branch triple the optimizer footprint; see the trainer CLI's
//! `--branch-dtype`); the `+1`-folded RMSNorm scales stay f32 (tiny, and [`rms_scale_diff`] reduces
//! in f32 anyway). Weights are cast to the activation dtype inside the forward when they differ —
//! the cast is differentiable, so f32 master-weight training works through the same code path.
//!
//! **Checkpoint format (spike).** A flat `.safetensors` of the branch tensors keyed
//! `blocks.{i}.<leaf>` (norm scales stored **pre-folded** `scale + 1` under `*.weight_p1` — this
//! checkpoint is only read back by [`ControlBranch::from_checkpoint`], never by a diffusers loader),
//! plus `blocks.{i}.proj_out.weight` for the zero-init projections. `N` is inferred from the keys.
