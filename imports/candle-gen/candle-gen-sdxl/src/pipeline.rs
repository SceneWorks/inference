//! The candle SDXL **txt2img** pipeline (sc-3675) — the proven epic-3494 prototype
//! (`D:\sceneworks-candle-spike\src\bin\candle_sdxl.rs`) lifted out of its standalone CLI/PNG shell
//! and into the backend-neutral [`gen_core::Generator`] contract.
//!
//! What changed vs the spike, and what deliberately did **not**:
//! - **Components** (the GO-validated path): dual CLIP (CLIP-L + CLIP-bigG) loaded **f16** (sc-3674;
//!   the spike used f32) and encoded; UNet **f16**; VAE **f16** with the `madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix`
//!   (f16 SDXL VAE NaNs without it); VAE scale **0.13025** (the diffusers SDXL value, not candle's
//!   hardcoded SD1.5 0.18215).
//! - **Perf (sc-3674)**: the UNet attention runs through fused **flash-attention** when the crate is
//!   built `--features flash-attn` AND the runtime toggle ([`crate::set_flash_attn`], default on) is
//!   set — on Blackwell sm_120 that cut steady-state from ~0.32 to ~0.21 s/step and peak VRAM ~21.6→18
//!   GiB. The build feature is the opt-in; the toggle is what the SceneWorks UI exposes.
//! - **Peak VRAM (sc-4987)**: two structural levers on top of sc-3674's 18 GiB high-water mark, both
//!   targeting torch-parity (~9 GiB) at 1024². (1) **Staged sequential load** — each CLIP encoder is
//!   loaded, run, and **dropped** before the next, and *both* are gone before the UNet/VAE even load
//!   (text embeddings are seed-independent, computed once up front), so the dual CLIP (~1.6 GiB f16)
//!   never sits resident through denoise/decode. (2) **VAE tiling** — the VAE decode at 1024² is the
//!   tallest single allocation; [`tile_blend_decode`] splits the latent into overlapping 64² latent
//!   tiles (512² output), decodes each, and trapezoidally blends the seams (diffusers'
//!   `enable_vae_tiling`), bounding the decode peak to one tile. Gated by [`crate::vae_tiling_enabled`]
//!   (default on) and only *fires* above 512² output (the geometry policy lives in [`gen_core::tiling`]).
//! - **Deterministic seeding + non-ancestral scheduler (sc-3673)**: initial noise is drawn from a
//!   fixed-algorithm CPU RNG (`StdRng`) seeded by `seed` and moved to the device — NOT candle's CUDA
//!   `device.set_seed`, whose seed→noise mapping was not portable across launch environments and
//!   occasionally collapsed the sample (sc-3498). The sampler is **DDIM (eta=0)**, non-ancestral, so
//!   there is no per-step stochastic noise. Net: generation is a pure function of `(seed, request)`.
//! - **CLI/`emit_event`/PNG/sidecar removed**: progress is `on_progress(Progress::Step/Decoding)`,
//!   cancellation is `req.cancel` → typed [`gen_core::Error::Canceled`], and each image is returned as a
//!   `gen_core::Image` (RGB8) — the worker owns asset writes (no candle-specific worker code).
//! - **Weights come from `spec.weights` (the SDXL snapshot dir)**, not a hardcoded HF repo: UNet +
//!   both text encoders load from the snapshot's component subdirs. The two **model-agnostic** inputs
//!   — the fp16-VAE-fix and the CLIP-L/bigG `tokenizer.json`s — still resolve via `hf-hub` (cached),
//!   exactly as the spike.
//!
//! - **Component caching (sc-5037)**: the seed/prompt/resolution-independent [`Components`] (UNet +
//!   VAE) are loaded once and **cached on the generator** across `generate` calls (keyed by the
//!   flash-attn setting), so back-to-back requests skip the ~7 GiB UNet/VAE disk re-read. This is
//!   reconciled with the sc-4987 staged load rather than reverting it: CLIP stays
//!   load-on-demand-and-free (only one encoder resident at a time), and the generator computes the
//!   text embeddings *before* acquiring the cached UNet/VAE — so the cold-call ordering (CLIP freed
//!   before UNet/VAE load) and the ~8.7 GiB peak are preserved; the cache holds only UNet+VAE
//!   resident between calls (a latency win, not a peak-VRAM regression).
//!
//! - **RealVisXL (sc-3677)**: RealVisXL_V5.0 (`SG161222/RealVisXL_V5.0`) shares the SDXL architecture
//!   AND ships the standard diffusers multi-component tree with the *same* component filenames this
//!   pipeline already resolves — `unet/diffusion_pytorch_model.fp16.safetensors`,
//!   `text_encoder{,_2}/model.fp16.safetensors`. So it loads through this exact snapshot path
//!   unmodified; the single-file root checkpoints it also publishes are not needed and no single-file
//!   loader was added (the [`snapshot_file`] component layout is present, not absent). The model-
//!   agnostic VAE-fix + CLIP tokenizers and the production defaults below ([`DEFAULT_STEPS`],
//!   [`DEFAULT_GUIDANCE`], [`VAE_SCALE`]) are shared, matching the Python `SdxlDiffusersAdapter`; the
//!   one accepted sampler difference (DDIM eta=0 vs the adapter's euler_ancestral) is the sc-3673
//!   launch-portable-determinism choice. Parity is locked by `tests/conformance.rs::realvisxl_conformance`.
