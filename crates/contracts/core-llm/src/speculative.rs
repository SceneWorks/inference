//! Backend-neutral speculative-decoding policy (epic 7153, stories 7171 + 7172).
//!
//! Speculative decoding generates several tokens per target forward by **proposing** a short
//! continuation cheaply, **verifying** it in one batched target forward, and **accepting** the
//! longest prefix the target agrees with. The proposal source differs by story — an n-gram match of
//! the context ([`ngram_propose`], story 7171) or a small draft model (story 7172) — but the
//! acceptance is the same distribution-preserving rule, so it lives here once, tensor-free, and both
//! backends ([`mlx-llm`], later `candle-llm`) reuse it.
//!
//! ## Distribution preservation
//! [`accept_token`] is the Leviathan et al. / Chen et al. speculative-sampling step: given the target
//! distribution `p` and the draft distribution `q` from which the proposed token was drawn, accept the
//! proposal with probability `min(1, p(t)/q(t))`, and on rejection resample from the normalized
//! residual `max(0, p − q)`. The committed token is then distributed **exactly** as `p` — speculative
//! decoding changes the *speed*, not the *output distribution*. Greedy decoding is the special case
//! where `p` is a point mass at the argmax: [`accept_greedy_run`] is the efficient form (accept the
//! longest draft prefix equal to the target's argmax).
//!
//! The acceptance functions take their random draws as parameters rather than owning an RNG, so this
//! module stays tensor-free *and* RNG-free — deterministic and exhaustively unit-testable, with the
//! backend feeding draws from its own seeded PRNG.
//!
//! ## The unified engine's policy (epic sc-24128, story sc-24130)
//! The Candle engine runs **one** speculative loop over its step-model seam with pluggable
//! proposers; the parts of that loop that are policy rather than tensor work live here so MLX can
//! adopt them unchanged: which proposer a request resolves to ([`resolve_speculative`],
//! [`ProposerKind`]; the proposer-agnostic request option since sc-24433) and the verify decision ([`greedy_commit`] for greedy, [`accept_token`] for
//! stochastic — the same acceptance rule as before, unchanged).
//!
//! [`mlx-llm`]: https://github.com/SceneWorks/mlx-llm
