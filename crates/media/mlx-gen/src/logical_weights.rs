//! MLX **mapped logical-weight reader** and the engine's **codec table** (epic 20398, sc-20634;
//! ComfyUI descriptor codecs sc-20385).
//!
//! The shared seam every MLX family provider reads imported checkpoints through:
//!
//! 1. the provider supplies its adapter-owned [`LogicalKeyMapping`] (the same `mapping_id` its
//!    registry adapter row declares);
//! 2. [`plan_logical_weights`] reads the safetensors **header** plus the (small) `.comfy_quant`
//!    descriptor payloads and compiles a [`LogicalWeightPlan`] against [`baseline_codec_registry`]
//!    — an unmapped key, a key collision, a stored format without a registered codec, a malformed
//!    descriptor, a missing/mis-shaped scale companion, or bad MXFP8 block geometry is a typed
//!    refusal naming the exact tensor, before any MLX array exists;
//! 3. [`read_logical_weights`] loads the planned tensors, renames each to its canonical logical
//!    key, runs the planned codec **per layer** (mixed checkpoints dispatch tensor-by-tensor), and
//!    returns a [`LogicalWeightReceipt`] whose resident bytes are measured from the decoded arrays.
//!
//! Codecs are registered **once** per platform catalog via [`register_checkpoint_codecs`]; the
//! registry rows and [`CODEC_IMPLEMENTATION_IDS`] are kept in lockstep by the catalog conformance
//! test, so a declared codec without an implementation (or vice versa) cannot ship.
//!
//! # fp8 files and MLX's loader
//!
//! MLX has no fp8/e8m0 storage dtype, so its own safetensors parser rejects any file carrying
//! `F8_E4M3` / `F8_E5M2` / `F8_E8M0` tensors. Those files load through a **header-rewriting custom
//! reader** (`load_planned_file`): the on-disk header is re-presented to MLX with each fp8 dtype
//! renamed to `U8` at identical byte length (element size is 1 in both readings, so every offset is
//! unchanged and the payload is byte-identical), and MLX's normal lazy `load` primitive then serves
//! the raw bytes file-backed. Laziness is preserved deliberately — the deferred mode's bounded
//! block-window consumers reopen the file per window and must not copy the whole checkpoint into
//! host RAM per reopen. The codec then decodes the `U8` view on device: E4M3 through MLX's own
//! byte-accurate `from_fp8`, E5M2 as the top byte of an IEEE binary16 (`u16 << 8` viewed as f16),
//! E8M0 as `2^(byte − 127)` (`u32 << 23` viewed as f32), each multiplied by its planned scale in
//! f32 and cast once to the codec's resident bf16 — the same reference math as
//! `gen_core::comfy_quant`, which the goldens pin.
//!
//! Residency is priced **per layer** by the plan ([`gen_core::PlannedResidency`]): MLX has no
//! packed fp8/int8 matmul on this seam, so its policy is [`DenseResidencyPolicy`] — every
//! quantized layer prices at its dense bf16 form and every scale/descriptor companion is consumed.
//! The receipt's measured bytes equal the plan's `resident_bytes()`; that pair is the
//! packed-vs-dense pricing seam admission reads.
