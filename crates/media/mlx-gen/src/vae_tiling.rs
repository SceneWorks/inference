//! Array-level **tiled VAE decode** (sc-11747) — the MLX/tensor half of the gen-core tiling seam.
//!
//! [`crate::tiling`] (re-exported from gen-core) is the **pure** half: tiling presets, the per-axis
//! interval split, the 1-D trapezoidal blend mask, and the [`TilePlan`] for a latent — no tensor dep,
//! Linux-buildable. This module is the tensor half: given a [`TilePlan`] and a per-tile decode closure,
//! it slices each overlapping tile out of the (already-denormalized) latent, decodes it, trapezoidally
//! blends the results, and folds them into the full output while keeping the peak bounded by one tile's
//! decode. sc-18320 replaced the pad-every-tile-to-the-full-output accumulator with a per-axis fold —
//! see [`tiled_decode_with_hooks`] for the mechanics and what they deliberately leave unchanged.
//!
//! It is **layout-agnostic** (the caller passes the `[t, h, w]` axis indices for NCTHW vs channels-last
//! and a decode closure that reaches its own VAE's decoder), so every VAE that tiles a whole decode tail
//! shares it: the Wan z16/z48 video VAEs (`mlx-gen-wan`, via a thin `vae_common` delegator preserving
//! their call sites), the LTX video VAE (`mlx-gen-ltx`, via [`tiled_decode_with_hooks`] for its
//! per-tile cache release), the Qwen-Image still-image VAE (`mlx-gen-qwen-image`, the Krea 2
//! pose-control decode sc-11747 bounds), and Sana's and Mage's image VAEs. Lifting it here removes the
//! divergence hazard of a per-crate copy of this subtle slice/blend/place/accumulate loop (the Wan
//! sc-4998/sc-5690 seam-artifact history).
//!
//! The AutoencoderKL/Z-Image/FLUX.2 families do **not** come through here: sc-19753 converted them to
//! layer-wise tiling ([`GlobalGroupNorm`] + [`tiled_conv2d_3x3_nhwc`]), which partitions each 3×3
//! convolution into halo-expanded cores and needs no blend at all.

/// intermediate axis strips are smaller than the output by the ratio the untiled axes contribute.
///
/// Re-association means the accumulated blend weight factorizes exactly
/// (`Σ_{i,j,k} tm_i·hm_j·wm_k = (Σ_i tm_i)(Σ_j hm_j)(Σ_k wm_k)`), so [`AxisCoverage`] carries the
/// normalizer as three 1-D host vectors and materializes it once at the end — replacing a second

///
/// **What does not change.** The per-tile blend weights, the tile geometry, and the final
/// `Σwd / max(Σw, 1e-8)` normalization are identical, so the *effective* weight each tile's decode
/// carries at each output coordinate is bit-for-bit the same profile as before: the conv-halo seam
/// term an overlap narrower than the decoder's receptive field leaves behind is attenuated exactly as
/// much as it was, neither more nor less. Only the summation's association changes, which moves
/// results by float rounding (~1 ULP over the ≤8 tiles that cover any coordinate), not by blend
/// characteristic. Globally-scoped decode work stays where its caller put it — this function only
/// ever sees the tile closure it is handed, so a head that runs once on the whole latent (sc-19753)
