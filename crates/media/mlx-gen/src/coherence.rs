//! GPU-view coherence of freshly loaded weight buffers (sc-22414).
//!
//! # The defect this closes
//!
//! A safetensors `Load` runs on the CPU stream: MLX allocates a Metal shared buffer and `pread`s
//! the file into it. Under a full page cache with dirty write-back pressure, the **GPU's view of
//! that buffer can lag the CPU's**: the first Metal kernel to read it sees exact zeros for pages
//! the CPU already holds correctly, and a later kernel sees the real bytes. Measured on Mac2
//! (Mac17,6, 128 GB, macOS 26.6.1; 6/6 reproductions, see SceneWorks
//! `docs/calibration/sc-18791/mac2-cold-load/RUNBOOK.md`): LTX-2.5's once-loaded 2 GB Gemma 4
//! `embed_tokens` table read as zeros on render 1's first pass while every CPU-side hash of the
//! same buffer was correct, every layer weight was correct at both views, and the same handle read
//! correctly minutes later. An all-zero embedding maps through RMSNorm, SDPA and the residual adds
//! to an all-zero stack, so the render is deterministic garbage rather than a crash — the
//! measured-vs-warm parity breach that blocked the SC-18791 campaign.
//!
//! Ruled out there by experiment: the OS version, the sampler, a CPU→GPU fence race (a
//! materialization barrier before the forward changed nothing), read errors and short reads in
//! MLX's reader, uncached reads alone, read churn alone, and user-space staging of the read (the
//! CPU view was never wrong). Time heals it: every variant that slowed the load down passed.
//!
//! # The fix
//!
//! Verify the GPU's view against the CPU's at the load boundary, before any graph consumes the
//! buffer, and wait for them to agree. [`byte_checksum`] is a **wrapping integer sum of the raw
//! bytes** read through a given stream: modular addition is order-independent, so a CPU reduction
//! and a GPU reduction over the same bytes are bit-identical regardless of how each backend
//! partitions the sum (a float sum would not be). [`verify_gpu_view`] evaluates each array on its
//! own stream, takes the CPU checksum as the reference, and re-reads the GPU checksum with a
//! bounded back-off until it matches. Exhausting the budget is a typed
//! [`Error::IncoherentLoad`], never a silent retry-forever and never a silent render.
//!
//! The check is a GPU read of every loaded byte plus a CPU read of the same — cheap against the
//! load itself, and the GPU read is the one that would otherwise have happened inside the first
//! forward.
//!
//! # Mirrored, not shared
//!
//! This is a deliberate twin of `mlx_llm::primitives::coherence`: `mlx-gen` does not depend on
//! `mlx-llm`, so — exactly like the two `Weights` types — the semantics are mirrored and the names
//! kept identical. [`Weights::materialize`](crate::weights::Weights::materialize) and
//! [`Weights::materialize_accessed`](crate::weights::Weights::materialize_accessed) are the two
//! seams, and both call [`verify_gpu_view`] — so a loader is guarded exactly when it materializes
//! through one of them. The LTX-2.5 render path does at every load (text encoder, connector, DiT
//! resident or streamed, VAEs, vocoder, upsamplers, duration head, adapters, enhancer), as do the
//! block-window streams (krea, z-image, qwen-image, flux2, sdxl, boogu). A provider that never
//! materializes — evaluating its checkpoint inside its first forward — is **not** guarded by this
//! module; guarding it means adding the `materialize` call at its load seam, which also changes
//! when its weights become resident, so that is a per-provider decision rather than a blanket one.
