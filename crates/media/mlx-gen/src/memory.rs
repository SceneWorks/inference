//! MLX device memory limits for budget-aware tiling.
//!
//! The shared budget convention across the engine crates (seedvr2, wan, …) is "this machine's MLX
//! memory limit × [`SAFE_FRAC`]". That works for the *OS-kill* / MLX-backpressure bound — but it
//! ignores Metal's **per-single-buffer** cap [`maxBufferLength`]: MLX's metal allocator throws at
//! `allocator.cpp` when any one allocation exceeds it (the `"[metal::malloc] … maximum allowed buffer
//! size"` OOM). On a high-RAM Mac with no user GPU cap, the MLX memory limit defaults to ≈ 1.5× the
//! device working set, so `limit × 0.85` can sit *above* `maxBufferLength` — and a budget-sized tile
//! then admits a single allocation that blows past the per-buffer cap (sc-8135: SeedVR2 4× → 4096²
//! OOMs). [`safe_budget_gib`] clamps the budget by the cap so tiling always keeps every single
//! allocation under it, regardless of total RAM / MLX limit / user cap.
//!
//! [`maxBufferLength`]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metal/mtldevice/3043259-maxbufferlength

///   re-read is still a memcpy rather than a disk read. On a real small Mac under pressure the page
///   cache is the first thing evicted, so a re-materialization cost measured under this cap is a
