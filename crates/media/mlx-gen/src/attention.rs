//! **Bounded attention** (rung 3 of the SC-15448 ladder): the MLX **kernel**.
//!
//! The **planner** — [`AttentionBudget`], [`CONSTRAINED_ATTN_SCORES_BUDGET`] and the query-block
//! arithmetic — lives in [`gen_core::attention_budget`] and is re-exported below, so this module keeps
//! its public shape while the chunk boundaries come from the same place every backend's do (SC-15793).
//! That is the shared-ladder split rungs 2 (`gen_core::tiling`) and 4 (`gen_core::block_window`)
//! already use.
//!
//! What stays here is genuinely MLX's: [`sdpa_budgeted_bhsd`], the `slice_axis` helper, and the
//! per-chunk `eval`. The kernels must NOT merge — measured like-for-like on the denoise phase, this
//! rung is worth **−32% on candle and −1.7% here**, roughly an order of magnitude apart, precisely
//! because the kernels differ; see the attribution table below and the [`gen_core::attention_budget`]
//! module doc. (MLX's often-quoted −5.0% is the whole-request figure, not the denoise phase — the two
//! are not interchangeable when comparing backends.)
//!
//! The lever is query-row chunking: every query row's softmax is over **all** keys and is independent
//! of the other rows, so running the attention over blocks of query rows leaves each query's complete
//! key/value domain intact while bounding the per-call attention scratch to `chunk_rows × Sk` scores
//! instead of `Sq × Sk`. Precision, schedule, seed, conditioning, and the output contract are
//! untouched: the same [`scaled_dot_product_attention`] is called with the same `scale`, the same
//! dtypes, and the same k/v.
//!
//! ## What this bounds on MLX — measured (SC-15615)
//!
//! candle's CPU/CUDA `attention_basic` **materializes** the whole `[B,H,Sq,Sk]` scores tensor, so
//! bounding it there is a large unconditional win — that is what bought the Candle Z-Image 8 GB fit
//! (staged Q4 denoise 8.394 → 5.709 GB, SC-15256).
//!
//! **MLX never materializes it.** `fast::scaled_dot_product_attention` dispatches to a fused Metal
//! kernel that streams the scores. Measured in isolation on Apple M5 Max at the production Z-Image
//! DiT shape (B=1, H=30, D=128, f32), the unbounded peak is exactly `4 · B·H·Sq·D · sizeof(dtype)` —
//! q, k, v and the output, nothing else (241.9 MiB at Sq=4128, 961.9 MiB at Sq=16416; a materialized
//! score tensor at Sq=16416 would alone be 30 GiB). `at_the_production_shape_sdpa_streams_the_scores_and_chunking_is_exact`
//! pins that. So there is **no score tensor for this helper to bound**, and in isolation — with q/k/v
//! already materialized and pinned alive — chunking only *adds* transients (+50% peak).
//!
//! Inside a real DiT forward the result inverts, for a different reason. There q/k/v are intermediates
//! in a deep lazy graph, and `AttentionBudget::eval_per_chunk` cuts that graph at every chunk
//! boundary, letting MLX free upstream transients earlier. Measured on the real Z-Image-turbo q4 DiT
//! (1024², 4 steps, staged residency):
//!
//! | Arm | Denoise peak | vs unbounded |
//! |---|---:|---:|
//! | unbounded | 4.7746 GiB | — |
//! | 64 Mi chunk, lazy (no per-chunk eval) | 4.7708 GiB | −0.08% (noise) |
//! | 64 Mi chunk + per-chunk eval | 4.6944 GiB | **−1.7%** |
//! | never-chunks budget + eval flag (control) | 4.7747 GiB | +0.00% |
//!
//! The control arm is the important one: setting `eval_per_chunk` on a budget that never chunks is
//! inert, so the saving is genuinely produced by chunking — but by the **graph cut** it forces, not by
//! bounding a score matrix. It is therefore real, quality-preserving (`sum|out|` identical to the last
//! digit across all four arms) and *small* — nothing like CUDA's 32%. End to end through the staged
//! generate it measured 4.898 → 4.653 GiB (−5.0%) with a bit-identical image.
//!
//! Whether a given family/geometry benefits stays a measurement, never an assumption:
//! [`AttentionBudget::UNBOUNDED`] is the default and every caller keeps the single-call path until a
//! measured rung selects otherwise. A family whose attention *is* materialized (a hand-rolled
//! `matmul → softmax → matmul`, or a shape the fused kernel rejects) gets the full CUDA-style saving
//! from this same seam instead of forking its own copy.
//!
//! ## Laziness
//!
//! MLX is lazy, and per the table above the laziness is where the whole MLX-side saving lives.
//! `AttentionBudget::eval_per_chunk` forces each chunk's output to be materialized before the next
//! chunk is built — the same lever `mlx_gen_flux2::chunk::MemoryConfig::eval_per_block` uses one level
//! up. It is **bit-exact** (it only forces materialization) and costs one synchronization per chunk.
//! [`AttentionBudget::CONSTRAINED`] therefore sets it; a lazily-chunked budget measured as no better
//! than unbounded.
//!
//! `eval` is not valid inside an autograd trace, so `eval_per_chunk` must stay
//! `false` on training paths. The trainers never select a bounded rung (the default is
//! [`AttentionBudget::UNBOUNDED`], whose fast path is a single unchunked call), so this is structural
//! rather than a runtime guard.
