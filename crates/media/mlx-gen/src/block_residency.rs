//! Rung 4 — **bounded transformer residency**, the MLX half (SC-15750, hoisted by SC-15790).
//!
//! The schedule itself lives in [`gen_core::block_window`]: window arithmetic, loop order, release
//! discipline and the cancellation contract are identical on every backend. This module supplies the
//! two MLX-specific operations and keeps the call shape the providers already use.
//!
//! MLX's half is small on purpose:
//! - the view is [`Weights`] — `Array` handles from `load_safetensors`, which are **lazy per tensor**
//!   (1073 handles cost 0.0 MiB until something is evaluated), so re-opening per window is nearly free;
//! - the release is `mlx_rs::memory::clear_cache()`.
//!
//! ## Measured on MLX (SC-15744 / SC-15750, real z-image-turbo q4, Apple/Metal)
//!
//! These are MLX numbers and establish only that the shape works — they predict nothing about another
//! backend, which is the rule rung 3 taught the hard way (~6x different value across backends).
//!
//! One block materializes at **97.3 MiB** against a header-computed 97.1 MiB — no hidden copy.
//! Dropping returns it: active falls to 8.0 MiB and stays flat across all 30 blocks. Packed-quant
//! survives it — `quantized_matmul` works on a per-block materialized `weight`/`scales`/`biases`
//! triple, because each is an independent file entry rather than a slice of one packed buffer.
//!
//! | window | peak | vs resident |
//! |---:|---:|---:|
//! | 1 | 8.0 MiB | 29.9x |
//! | 2 | 15.9 MiB | 15.0x |
//! | 4 | 31.8 MiB | 7.5x |
//! | 8 | 63.6 MiB | 3.7x |
//! | 30 (resident) | 238.4 MiB | — |
//!
//! Linear in window size, which is the contract. Re-materializing every block once per denoise step
//! cost ~0.309 s/step with a warm page cache on a 128 GB machine — the OPTIMISTIC bound, since the
//! hosts this rung exists for are small Macs under pressure where the page cache is evicted first.
//!
//! ## The trap, and why it is MLX's reason and not a universal one
//!
//! MLX is lazy, so the carried activation is an unevaluated graph node still referencing the window's
//! weights: **dropping before forcing evaluation frees nothing**. Measured at window = 1, **8.0 MiB
//! with the guard vs 238.4 MiB without** — identical to fully resident, with correct output either
//! way. Silent, not loud. `block_window_without_materialize_frees_nothing` pins it.
//!
//! An eager backend has no lazy graph to cut and may not need this at all — or may need it for an
//! unrelated reason. [`gen_core::block_window`] carries the obligation's shape; the reason is per
//! backend and must be measured there.
