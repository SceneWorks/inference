//! Production capability switches for the shared MLX optimization surface (sc-18316, sc-18318).
//!
//! P1 retained compilation and P3 exact epilogues both shipped behind
//! [`crate::diagnostics::toggle_requested`], which is `false` unless a diagnostic scope names the
//! toggle — and the only non-test installer was the benchmark binary. Every production render
//! therefore took the discarded-handle / composed arm: exactly the pathology the two stories were
//! filed to remove. This module is the seam that fixes that. Both are now real capabilities whose
//! **production default is on**, with the benchmark keeping A/B authority through
//! [`crate::diagnostics::capability_override`] and any path that genuinely cannot run one keeping a
//! truthful opt-out ([`CapabilityOptOut`]) instead of a silent fallback.
//!
//! # Resolution order
//!
//! [`enabled`] answers in this order, and the order is load-bearing:
//!
//! 1. **An installed [`CapabilityOptOut`] wins.** An opt-out exists because a path cannot correctly
//!    run the capability, so a benchmark request must not be able to force it back on. When a
//!    benchmark did request it, the opt-out emits [`ToggleDisposition::Unavailable`] — the campaign
//!    then fails its receipt validation loudly rather than measuring a path it did not select.
//! 2. **An [`crate::diagnostics::CapabilityAuthority::Override`] scope decides.** Membership of the
//!    requested-toggle set forces on *and* off, which is what the P6 matrix compares.
//! 3. **Otherwise the production default: on.**
//!
//! # Why enabling these cannot change output
//!
//! Neither capability is an approximation. P1 replaces a per-call `compile(f, true)(args)` — a fresh
//! handle, traced and leased per call — with a retained handle over the **same** graph function, so
//! the executed kernel is identical and only its construction is amortized. P3 substitutes MLX's
//! native fused epilogue for the composed expression only where it is **bit-exact**, and reports a
//! per-operation [`ToggleDisposition::Fallback`] otherwise. The accepted MLX tile-shape ULP context
//! (fused-vs-unfused GEMM tiling differing by 1 ULP) does **not** apply: it concerns a fused *matmul
//! tiling* choice, whereas these epilogues are asserted `array_eq` against the composed baseline
//! across every supported dtype, layout, group size, and bit width in `nn`'s P3 suite, and the P1
//! sites are proven bit-identical to their eager and one-shot forms.
//!
//! # Memory tradeoff of a default-on retention
//!
//! Retention keeps MLX compiled-graph state alive for the owning **thread's** lifetime instead of
//! erasing it after every call, and with a production default that now happens on every render
//! thread rather than only under the benchmark. That is bounded and does not disturb the memory
//! contracts:
//!
//! * **Nothing capturing a tensor is retained.** Every retained handle in this workspace wraps a
//!   plain, non-capturing `fn` item over its inputs (`gated_impl`, `modulate_impl`,
//!   `rope_rotate_impl`, `gelu_ffn_impl`, `swiglu_impl`, `add_hint_impl`, `silu_glue_impl`, and this
//!   crate's `compiled_*` graph functions). A retained handle therefore cannot pin a request's
//!   inputs/outputs or a component's weights, so it cannot keep an **evicted** component resident and
//!   the residency/eviction paths need no new release hook.
//! * **What it does hold** is compiler metadata, the built kernels, and any constant traced *inside*
//!   the graph function — a handful of four-byte scalars such as the literal `1` in the adaLN affine.
//!   That is bytes per signature, not the megabytes the fit gate budgets, so a fit decision computed
//!   from weights plus activations stays valid. `mlx::get_peak_memory` reports **active** rather than
//!   cached bytes, so it too is unaffected by kernel caching.
//! * **Measured, not argued**: `nn`'s serialized
//!   `retained_compile_handles_do_not_pin_request_arrays` audit, run against this change, reports
//!   `retained_active=4` bytes and `retained_cache=0` while the whole 25-handle inventory is alive
//!   after a 4 MiB (`request_bytes=4194304`) request — four bytes, the one traced f32 constant. The
//!   benchmark's retention-memory receipt bounds the same aggregate independently.
//! * **Release is deliberately not per-request.** Reuse *across* requests is the entire P1 gain, so
//!   [`crate::nn::release_retained_compile_glue`] is an explicit thread-level reclaim for a worker
//!   shutting down or trimming, not something a request scope calls on `finish`.
