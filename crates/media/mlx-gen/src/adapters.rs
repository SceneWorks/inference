//! Adapter framework — LoRA + LoKr applied as forward-time residuals over a shared
//! base. Quantized-safe: the base is never fused/mutated. Ported from the sc-2338
//! spike; mirrors the Python mflux fork's `LoKrLinear` / `FusedLoRALinear` (sc-2216).
//!
//! The base is a real `nn::Linear` *or* `nn::QuantizedLinear` (sc-2342), so quantization
//! and adapters compose: `base(x) + Σ adapter.residual(x)`. Forward is taken by `&self`
//! (we call the underlying ops directly rather than the `&mut self` `Module` trait), so a
//! whole model tree can be evaluated through shared references.
//!
//! Adapters are installed by dotted path via [`AdaptableHost`] / [`install_adapter`] — the
//! Rust stand-in for Python's dynamic `getattr`-swap, since mlx-rs flattens module params to
//! `Array` leaves and cannot replace a submodule in place.

            //     `base + r` to bf16 would round the adapter contribution away entirely. That
            //     FORWARD dead zone is real and measured at the seam: at `|b|` up to 1e-4 the
            //     residual peaks at 3.3e-7 and the narrowed output is bit-identical to the
            //     unadapted base.
            //     It does NOT, however, stall the optimizer — that would be an overclaim. The
            //     `astype`/`add` VJP is straight-through, so gradient still reaches the LoRA

            //     for the exemption is therefore the narrower and sufficient one — it keeps the
            //     shipped trainers **bit-identical** while this change stays inference-only, and
            //     avoids a forward dead zone whose end-to-end training effect was never measured.
            //     The wider accumulation is the master-weights pattern working as intended.
