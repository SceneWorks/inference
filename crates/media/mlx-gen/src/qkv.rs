//! **The parameterized QK-norm + RoPE + layout primitive** and the **adapter/quant-aware fused QKV
//! projection** (SC-18319, epic 18304 P4).
//!
//! Every DiT/MMDiT family in this tree runs the same five-stage prologue between its attention
//! projections and [`scaled_dot_product_attention`](mlx_rs::fast::scaled_dot_product_attention):
//!
//! ```text
//!   project → [full-dim QK-norm] → head split → [per-head QK-norm] → RoPE → [repeat-KV] → BHSD
//! ```
//!
//! Before this module each family open-coded that prologue, so a fix (or a fusion) had to be
//! travelled by hand ~20 times. What differs between families is *not* the pipeline — it is a
//! bounded set of **knobs**, each one demanded by a named, surveyed family. This module carries the
//! pipeline once and the knobs as data.
//!
//! ## The knob set, and who demands each
//!
//! | # | knob | type | demanded by |
//! |---|------|------|-------------|
//! | 1 | per-head vs full-dim QK-norm, post- vs pre-head-split | [`QkNormPlacement`] | LTX (full-dim, pre-split), Wan, SANA vs everyone else |
//! | 2 | interleaved/adjacent-pair vs half-split rotation | [`RopeStyle`] | Lens/Mage/PID/Boogu/Mochi vs Ideogram/Anima vs LTX |
//! | 3 | RoPE optional | [`RopeStyle::None`] per call | Anima DiT cross-attention, LTX text cross-attention, Krea |
//! | 4 | RoPE partial (leading `rot` channels, tail passthrough) | [`RopeSpec::rot_dims`] | SeedVR2 |
//! | 5 | RoPE on one stream only | [`RopeSpec::q`]/[`RopeSpec::k`] independently `None` | Mage (image only), Mochi |
//! | 6 | separate q and k position tables | [`RopeSpec::q`]/[`RopeSpec::k`] carry different tables | Anima conditioner, LTX cross-modal (`k_pe`) |
//! | 7 | RoPE = none for a whole family | [`RopeStyle::None`] | SD3 |
//! | 8 | concat-then-RoPE vs RoPE-then-concat | call order: [`StreamOrder::join`] before or after [`apply_rope`] | Chroma vs FLUX.1 |
//! | 9 | fused vs separate QKV | [`QkvSource`] / [`FusedQkvProjection`] | Lens/Ideogram/PID fused; Mage/SD3/Chroma/Boogu separate |
//! | 10 | GQA ratio, repeat-KV placed **after** RoPE | [`AttnPrepSpec::kv_heads`] | Boogu (28/7), Krea |
//! | 11 | stream order `[img,txt]` vs `[txt,img]` | [`StreamOrder`] | Lens/Ideogram (`[img,txt]`) vs Mage/Chroma/PID (`[txt,img]`) |
//! | 12 | dtype handed to SDPA after the rotation | [`RopeDtype`] | Ideogram/Anima/PID (promotion stands ⇒ f32 SDPA) vs Lens/Boogu/Mage/LTX (restored ⇒ bf16 SDPA) |
//!
//! Knob 12 was **not** in the original survey. It surfaced when the per-family fixtures were run at
//! each family's real dtype rather than in f32: every family builds f32 `(cos, sin)` tables, so the
//! rotation promotes a bf16 stream, and whether the family casts the result back decides whether its
//! attention runs in bf16 or f32. In an f32 fixture the two are indistinguishable. See [`RopeDtype`].
//!
//! Two further fields exist for **bit-exactness**, not expressiveness: [`AttnPrepSpec::rotation_axes`]
//! (whether a family rotates in `[B,S,H,D]` or after the transpose to `[B,H,S,D]`) and
//! [`NormDtype`]'s precision policies. Both rotations and RMSNorm act on the last axis and broadcast
//! over the head axis, so the two axis orders are numerically identical — but keeping each family's
//! *own* order means the migration is provably a no-op rather than "should be a no-op".
//!
//! ## What this module deliberately does NOT do
//!
//! * **It does not pack QK-norm scales.** `config/tier-integrity.jsonc` (SceneWorks) and its
//!   executable counterpart `gen_core::tier_integrity` forbid declaring or packing per-channel /
//!   per-token vectors — RMSNorm/LayerNorm/QK-norm scales, modulation and bias vectors — because no
//!   packer in the tree targets them at any tier. QK-norm weights are therefore *borrowed by
//!   reference* at call time ([`QkNormSpec`]) and never folded into a fused matrix.
//! * **It does not re-fuse what is already fused.** Dense `linear+bias` is already one `addmm`
//!   (`adapters.rs`, sc-2779); quantized `linear+bias` already goes through
//!   [`nn::quantized_matmul_with_bias`](crate::nn::quantized_matmul_with_bias); FLUX.2's single block
//!   already ships one `[q|k|v|mlp]` matrix; Qwen's vision tower already ships a fused `qkv`; the
//!   elementwise glue is already compiled; and MLX's SDPA is already one fused Metal kernel.
//! * **It does not fuse across a family boundary.** Nothing here builds a matrix shared by two
//!   families — see the group-size discussion on [`FusedQkvProjection`].
//!
//! ## Structural exemptions
//!
//! Eleven attention paths in this tree are *not* expressible here and stay on their native code.
//! Each one, with its specific deviation and file reference, is recorded in
//! [`EXEMPTIONS`] — a compiled-in table, so the justification cannot drift away from the code.

/// The packed matrix **replaces** the three bases; it is not built alongside them. That is a

/// the packed matrix back into three projections when one is needed (exactly, by row range), and
/// [`Self::repack`] returns to the packed form.
///
/// ## Adapters (the designed-against failure)
///
/// [`AdaptableLinear`]'s contract is `base(x) + Σ adapter.residual(x)`, and the base weight is never
/// mutated. A packed matrix is built from the **bases only**, so a fused forward that ignored the
/// adapter stack would *silently drop every installed LoRA/LoKr* — a running model producing
/// un-adapted output with no error.
///
/// This type makes that unrepresentable rather than merely checked. [`Self::parts_mut`], the only
/// way to reach an [`AdaptableLinear`] to install an adapter on, **unpacks first** and leaves the
/// projection in the split representation. A subsequent [`Self::repack`] re-runs the safety predicate,
/// which refuses while any live adapter is installed ([`NoFusion::AdaptersInstalled`]). So there is
/// no ordering in which a packed matrix and a live adapter coexist, and no forward-time check that
/// could be forgotten.
///
/// Applying the residuals *inside* the fusion was rejected: the three adapters have independent
/// ranks and scales and their residuals are per-projection, so folding them would mean three
/// low-rank matmuls plus the packed one — strictly more work than the unfused path it replaced.
///
/// A *disabled* adapter (`scale == 0`) does not block the pack: `AdaptableLinear::apply_adapters`
/// rule 1 skips it outright, so "installed at scale 0" is byte-identical to "never installed".
///
/// ## Quantization — effective bits must not change
///
/// MLX's group-wise affine quantization runs its groups along the **input** axis of a `[out, in]`
/// weight (`scales`/`biases` are `[out, in/group]`). Packing therefore concatenates on the **output**
/// axis (axis 0) of the weight, the scales and the biases together, which keeps every row's own
/// groups intact and every stored scale attached to exactly the codes it came from — the packed
/// matrix dequantizes to the byte-identical concatenation of the three originals, and
/// [`Self::unfuse`] inverts it by the same row ranges. That byte-level claim is exact on every
/// host and is asserted on the **tensors** (`qkv/tests.rs`'s
/// `unfusing_recovers_the_three_bases_exactly`), not inferred from a forward — see
/// [`Self::forward_packed`] for why a forward comparison is the weaker instrument.
///
/// The guard is deliberately **stricter** than that argument requires: a triple is packed only when
/// every part shares `bits` and `group_size`, every `in_features` is group-aligned (which the affine
/// format needs anyway), **and** every `out_features` is group-aligned. The `out` rule is the
/// conservative one, and it is the one that matters in practice: a family whose `out_features` is
/// not a multiple of its own group size is a family whose packer chose a non-default group, and
/// mixing it with anything else — or reshaping the packed output head-major — would cross a group
/// boundary. Boogu is exactly that family (`mlx-gen-boogu/src/quant.rs`: `GROUP_SIZE = 32`, kv
/// `out = 840`, `840 % 32 = 8`, `head_dim = 120`, `120 % 32 ≠ 0`), so its kv projections are
/// refused by construction and reported as [`NoFusion::OutFeaturesNotGroupAligned`]. Boogu also
/// never shares a packed matrix with any other family, because nothing here builds a matrix that
/// spans two families at all.
///
/// Nothing about the *activation* path changes: a packed base still goes through
/// [`nn::quantized_matmul_with_bias`](crate::nn::quantized_matmul_with_bias) with the activations
/// fed as-is, exactly as an unpacked one does. QK-norm scales are never packed (see the module doc's
/// tier-integrity note) — this type only ever touches projection weights.
///
/// ## Activation receipt
///
/// Every **forward** records
/// [`FUSED_ATTENTION_PRIMITIVES`](crate::diagnostics::FUSED_ATTENTION_PRIMITIVES) as
/// [`Applied`](crate::diagnostics::ToggleDisposition::Applied) or
/// [`Fallback`](crate::diagnostics::ToggleDisposition::Fallback) on the active diagnostic scope.
