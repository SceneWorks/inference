//! Lens / Lens-Turbo MLX shared image-memory ladder.
//!
//! SC-15800's dense-bf16 text-encoder-only result remains an independent legacy measurement. The
//! full ladder uses a new identity and does not relabel that result as DiT, Both, Q4, decode, or
//! attention evidence.
//!
//! # Declaration vs measurement (SC-18605)
//!
//! Before SC-18605 this module derived the *whole* contract from the measured-route key: a load that
//! was not the exact measured `lens` Q4 route or the exact legacy dense `lens_turbo` route published
//! nothing but [`MemoryStrategy::Resident`]. The engine did not agree. `generate_memory_impl` gates
//! staged residency, tiled decode and chunked attention on nothing at all — they are request levers
//! available on every load — and gates the rung-4 block window purely on
//! `can_stream_text`/`can_stream_dit`. So ten of the twelve `lens` registry surfaces and eleven
//! of the twelve `lens_turbo` surfaces carried an executable ladder that no consumer could ever
//! select, because it was undeclared. That is the inverse of the usual defect: the mechanism was
//! reachable, the declaration was not.
//!
//! The contract therefore now has two independent axes, and every consumer must read both:
//!
//! * **Support** — which rungs the engine can execute for this exact `(provider, LoadSpec)`. Derived
//!   from the engine's own predicates, never from the measured-route key.
//! * **Calibration identity** — whether a *measurement* backs this route. The two measured keys are
//!   unchanged and still bind to their exact envelopes. Every other route publishes no production
//!   calibration, so [`mlx_gen::gen_core::standard_memory_strategy_safety_check`] admits it only
//!   under an explicit [`mlx_gen::gen_core::MemoryOptimizationAuthority::Estimated`] authority.
//!
//! The weights-free declaration surface consumed by the catalog inventory substitutes a static
//! behavior identity ([`STATIC_BEHAVIOR_FINGERPRINT`]) for the absent production calibration so the
//! registry conformance walk can build a run context. That identity is never a measurement and never
//! appears on a contract built from a real load.
//!
//! ## The one asymmetry, deliberately kept
//!
//! `lens_turbo` at `bf16:sequential:deferred` is the single surface covered by the SC-15800 legacy
//! text-encoder measurement. It keeps exactly that envelope — rung 4 scoped to
//! [`TransformerComponent::TextEncoder`], with rungs 1-3 unpublished — because broadening it would
//! relabel that measurement as decode, attention or `Both` evidence, which the module contract above
//! forbids. Its five uncalibrated deferred siblings publish the full structural ladder. Closing that
//! gap needs a new `lens_turbo` measurement, not a wider declaration.

///   text-encoder measurement, and the route that carries it publishes a NARROWED envelope — rungs
///   1-3 unpublished, rung 4 scoped to [`TransformerComponent::TextEncoder`]. It must therefore not
