//! sc-15750 — rung 4 (`mlx_gen::block_residency`) bounds transformer weight residency on real
//! packed-quantized weights, and the materialize guard that makes it work is load-bearing.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d — needs the real `SceneWorks/z-image-turbo-mlx` q4 transformer in the HF cache:
//!   cargo test -p mlx-gen --release --test block_residency_real_weights -- --ignored --nocapture
//!
//! The "forward pass" here is a chain of `quantized_matmul` calls through each block's `attention.to_k`
//! triple. That is not the real Z-Image block, and deliberately so: this is the SHARED primitive's
//! test, so it must not depend on any one family's block. What it does reproduce faithfully is the
//! property the primitive has to survive — a **lazy graph chain** where each window's output still
//! references that window's weights until something forces evaluation.
