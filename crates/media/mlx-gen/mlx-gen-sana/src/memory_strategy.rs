//! Shared memory-strategy contract for base SANA and SANA-Sprint (SC-16783, extended by SC-15523).
//!
//! The provider implements Resident, load-time staged residency, the measured DC-AE tiled decode
//! ladder, and — since SC-15523 — bounded attention over `attn2` and bounded transformer residency
//! over the 20-block Linear-DiT stack.
//!
//! ## Rung 3's scope is `attn2` only, and that is architecture, not convenience
//!
//! SANA has two attentions per block and only one of them has anything for a score budget to bound:
//!
//! | site | kernel | score domain |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `attn1` (self) | ReLU-**linear**, `num = (V·Kᵀ)·Q` | none — the key axis is contracted into a `[B,H,hd,hd]` gram matrix |
//! | `attn2` (caption cross) | hand-rolled softmax SDPA, f32 | `[B, H, N, 300]`, explicitly materialized |
//!
//! So the rung is genuinely applicable (it is **not** `StructurallyNotApplicable`) and its reach is
//! genuinely one of the two sites. The key axis is fixed at 300 caption slots, so the domain grows
//! only with the token count `N = (edge/32)²` — 6.14 Mi f32 scores at 1024², which is why the
//! sibling families' 64 Mi operating point is inert here and SANA publishes its own budgets.
//!
//! **The exactness claim has a measured boundary.** Query-row chunking leaves each row's complete
//! k/v and both reductions untouched, but it changes the query GEMM's `M` dimension, and at `M = 1`
//! MLX dispatches a different (gemv) kernel whose accumulation order differs — measured at ~1e-6
//! relative on this provider. So rung 3 is bit-exact **over its published domain**, not
//! unconditionally: the narrowest chunk any published budget produces anywhere in the advertised
//! 256..=1024 range is **174 query rows**, and
//! `a_single_query_row_chunk_is_not_bit_exact_and_the_domain_cannot_reach_one` pins both halves of
//! that — the degenerate case is not exact, and the domain cannot reach it.
//!
//! ## Rung 4's availability is a per-LOAD fact
//!
//! A window rebuilds trunk blocks from the snapshot, so it needs a **re-openable source**
//! ([`WeightsSource::Dir`] — every registry load; SANA already refuses a single-file load) *and*
//! [`LoadShape::DeferredMaterialization`], which says the request wants those re-openable blocks
//! rather than a bulk-committed stack. `OffloadPolicy` is deliberately absent from that pair: phase
//! release and intra-phase block materialization are separate axes. The rung-1 edge is declared
//! separately as a per-provider `additional_prerequisites` entry, because
//! [`MemoryStrategy::engages`] does **not** make rung 4 engage rung 1 universally.
