//! Shared memory-strategy contract for the MLX Krea pose-control provider.
//!
//! This module declares only the quality-preserving mechanisms the provider actually executes.
//! Exact peak envelopes remain in SceneWorks' promoted calibration bundle.
//!
//! SC-15517's real q4 1024²/1-step pose-control A/B held staged residency plus the verified 512/64
//! decode in both arms. Adding 64 Mi-score attention to the resident seven-block pose branch and both
//! attention/windowing to the reopenable 28-block base DiT reduced request peak from 15.574 GiB to
//! 9.200 GiB (40.9%) with zero pixel delta. The overlay remains explicitly resident in
//! `resident_components`; only the base DiT advertises `TransformerComponent::Dit` windowing.
//!
//! # Declaration vs measurement (sc-18451)
//!
//! The two axes are independent here exactly as they are for the Lens and SD3.5 families:
//!
//! * **Support** — the rungs the pose-control engine can execute for this `(provider, LoadSpec)`.
//!   Derived from the loader's own predicates (`streamable_base_transformer` is the contract-side
//!   spelling of `crate::model::resolve_load_plan` plus the residency/materialization gates), never
//!   from the measured-route key.
//! * **Calibration identity** — whether a *measurement* backs the route. SC-15517 measured **q4 and
//!   nothing else** (SceneWorks' `krea_2_turbo_control` calibration plan is q4-only), so
//!   [`MEMORY_CALIBRATION_FINGERPRINT`] attaches to the q4 snapshot composition alone. The bf16 and
//!   q8 bases, the imported single-file DiT, and the additive Wan terminal decoder publish **no**
//!   calibration, which [`mlx_gen::gen_core::standard_memory_strategy_safety_check`] admits only
//!   under an explicit [`mlx_gen::gen_core::MemoryOptimizationAuthority::Estimated`] authority.
//!
//! Before sc-18451 the measured key was stamped unconditionally — on every tier, on the imported
//! file route, on the unmeasured Wan composite, and on the weights-free registry surface — so an
//! admission handshake against an unmeasured route succeeded under `Calibrated` authority. The
//! weights-free declaration surface now substitutes the source-owned
//! [`STATIC_BEHAVIOR_FINGERPRINT`], which is never a measurement and never appears on a contract
//! built from a real load.
