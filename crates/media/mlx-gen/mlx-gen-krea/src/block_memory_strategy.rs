//! SC-16352: request-scoped memory contract for the four base Krea 2 providers.
//!
//! Pose control has its own contract and seven-block control branch. This module covers the shared
//! 28-block base DiT used by Turbo, Raw, and their edit surfaces.
//!
//! The production domain is one block. Real `krea_2_turbo` weights at 512²/1 step measured the full
//! request (max of conditioning, denoise, decode) against an otherwise-identical Sequential + deferred
//! resident-stack attribution control:
//!
//! | tier / overlay | resident request | window 1 request | reduction |
//! |---|---:|---:|---:|
//! | q4 base | 11.928 GiB | 5.555 GiB | 53.4% |
//! | q8 base | 17.748 GiB | 5.715 GiB | 67.8% |
//! | bf16 base | 28.660 GiB | 8.383 GiB | 70.8% |
//! | q4 LoRA | 12.141 GiB | 5.768 GiB | 52.5% |
//! | q4 LoKr | 13.383 GiB | 7.010 GiB | 47.6% |
//!
//! Every windowed image was byte-identical to its resident control. Low-rank adapters are captured
//! and replayed per materialized block. A dense `.diff`/`.diff_b` patch is excluded at contract build
//! time because it mutates the resident base and cannot be reconstructed from the pristine snapshot.
//! The full-ladder rung-4 key includes `engaged_composition=[Resident, StagedResidency,
//! BoundedDecode, BoundedAttention, BoundedTransformerResidency]`: this loader reopens components
//! between phases, so block streaming is valid only when staged residency is active in the same
//! request.
//!
//! SC-15517 re-ran the complete q4 ladder at 1024²/1 step on the exact Turbo cache revision
//! `d009674080cc1bccf2b629d834c34bf5eccdb723`:
//!
//! | engaged composition | conditioning | denoise | decode | request |
//! |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
//! | staged | 3.105 GiB | 9.668 GiB | 15.674 GiB | 15.674 GiB |
//! | + 512/64 bounded decode | 3.044 GiB | 9.668 GiB | 12.013 GiB | 12.013 GiB |
//! | + 64 Mi-score attention | 3.380 GiB | 9.409 GiB | 12.013 GiB | 12.013 GiB |
//! | + DiT window 1 | 3.400 GiB | 3.316 GiB | 5.640 GiB | **5.640 GiB** |
//!
//! The attention and block-window arms were pixel-identical to the tiled-decode arm. The independent
//! real-Qwen-VAE 512/64 seam test measured max float delta `1.0857e-2`, mean `2.8614e-4` against the
//! untiled decoder. The final ladder therefore reduces request peak by 64.0% without changing denoise
//! numerics; the bounded-decode comparison retains the existing Qwen spatial blend tolerance.
//!
//! The optional Qwen PiD route uses the student's separately measured 2048/256 output-pixel tiling
//! domain. On exact PiD revision `39d7b0a9003a3fc934d36d8b5658b2d8ea9c1231`, Gemma revision
//! `684c553b5b41a1c835989d89f62f585e6269a7de`, and the same q4 Krea revision, a 768→3072 multitile
//! A/B measured staged+tiled request peak 21.848 GiB and full decode+attention+window peak 15.475 GiB
//! (29.2% lower), with max/mean pixel delta zero. Native and PiD decode domains remain disjoint and
//! are validated against `use_pid` at both admission and request-scope configuration.

/// route — run one DiT and one VAE, so they publish one set of axes.
///
/// `latent_channels` is [`crate::vae::VAE_CHANNELS`], the decoder's own width; the DiT's
/// `in_channels` 64 is the 2x2-packed view of it. `vae_temporal_scale` stays `None`: Krea 2 is an

/// snapshot's rather than the preset's. On the weights-free surface there is nothing to read and
/// the preset, which that parser itself falls back to per key, is the honest answer.
///
/// SC-22667: the two cases are now separated. A *missing* key degrades to the preset because

/// geometry. An `Err` — an unreadable file, malformed JSON, or a config that fails `validate` —
/// does NOT: `load_transformer_with_stream` propagates it and refuses the load, so publishing the
/// turbo preset would describe a model this snapshot cannot produce. The trunk axes are declared
/// absent there instead, which is the rule this very file already states 250 lines down for the
/// sibling base-config projection ("a config that IS present but unreadable or invalid propagates
