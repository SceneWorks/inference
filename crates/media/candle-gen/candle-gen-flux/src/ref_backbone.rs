//! A tier-detecting FLUX.1 backbone for the **reference** lanes (sc-10103, epic 9083) — the candle
//! twin of `mlx-gen-flux`'s `load_flux1`, which the MLX PuLID / IP-adapter providers delegate their
//! FLUX backbone to.
//!
//! The txt2img generator ([`crate::pipeline`]) already auto-detects the tier — a dense **BFL** snapshot
//! (`flux1-*.safetensors` + `ae.safetensors` at the root) vs a pre-quantized **diffusers-layout MLX
//! turnkey** (`SceneWorks/flux1-dev-mlx` q4/q8/bf16: `transformer/` + `text_encoder{,_2}/` + `vae/`) —
//! and builds the right CLIP / T5 / DiT / VAE for each (`Pipeline::load_components`). But that path was
//! wired only into `load_dev`/`load_schnell`; the reference providers (`candle-gen-pulid`, the FLUX
//! IP-adapter) built their backbone by hand from the single-file BFL layout and so could NOT read the
//! turnkey tiers.
//!
//! [`FluxRefBackbone`] closes that gap by **reusing the exact same** [`Pipeline::load_components`]
//! detect-and-load path the shipped txt2img generator uses, then exposing the three ops a reference lane
//! needs on top of it — [`encode_text`](FluxRefBackbone::encode_text),
//! [`forward_injected`](FluxRefBackbone::forward_injected) (the post-block [`DitImageInjector`] seam,
//! now on both the BFL [`IpFlux`](crate::ip_dit::IpFlux) and the diffusers
//! [`PackedFluxDit`](crate::packed_dit::PackedFluxDit)), and [`decode`](FluxRefBackbone::decode). So a
//! reference lane inherits whatever tier handling the base generator has (q4/q8/bf16), with one
//! packed-detect path and zero drift.
//!
//! PiD is **not** owned here: the PiD super-resolving decoder is a per-generation choice the reference
//! provider builds separately (PuLID's `with_pid`), so [`decode`](FluxRefBackbone::decode) takes the
//! decoder explicitly. The backbone loads with no PiD spec.
