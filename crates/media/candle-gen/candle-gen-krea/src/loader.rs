//! Weight loading for the Krea 2 DiT + Qwen3-VL-4B condition encoder — a thin shape-inferring wrapper
//! over candle's [`MmapedSafetensors`], mirroring `candle-gen-boogu`/`candle-gen-ideogram`'s `Weights`
//! interface so the port stays a near-1:1 translation of `mlx-gen-krea` (whose `Weights::from_dir`
//! loads the identity-keyed diffusers checkpoint directly). [`linear`] builds a [`Linear`] from the
//! actual `{base}.weight` (+ optional `{base}.bias`) tensor shapes.
//!
//! **Packed-tier detect (sc-9411).** When a component dir is an MLX-packed q4/q8 snapshot
//! (`SceneWorks/krea-2-turbo-mlx`, group size 64), each quantized projection is stored as the triple
//! `{base}.weight` (u32 codes) + `{base}.scales` + `{base}.biases`, and the component `config.json`
//! carries a `quantization: { bits, group_size }` block ([`candle_gen::quant::PackedConfig`]).
//! [`Weights::from_dir`] reads that block; [`linear_detect`] / [`embedding_detect`] then packed-**detect**
//! the `.scales` sibling and build the quantized module straight from the packed parts through the shared
//! group-size-aware loaders (no dense staging — see [`crate::quant`]). Absent the block / `.scales`, the
//! dense path is unchanged.
//!
//! **Adapter compose (sc-9411).** The DiT's `set_overlay` (adapter merge, sc-7836) installs dense
//! CPU-side weights that take priority over the mmap. [`linear_detect`] checks the **overlay first**: a
//! projection the adapter merge targeted resolves to its merged **dense** weight (the merge
//! reconstructs the dense base from the packed parts before folding, [`crate::adapters`]), while an
//! untargeted packed projection stays packed. So the packed base and the dense adapter overlay compose.
//! [`dequant_packed_base`] is the reconstruction the merge uses to build a mergeable dense base off the
//! packed triple.

// The community INT8-ConvRot checkpoint (`krea2_turbo_int8_convrot.safetensors`, a ComfyUI export) is
// **native-mmdit-keyed**, not diffusers-keyed like the published `krea/Krea-2-Turbo` this crate's DiT
// loads. The DiT `load()` / `validate_transformer` read diffusers keys (`transformer_blocks.N.attn.to_q`,
// `norm_q`, `ff.gate`, `norm1`, `time_mod_proj`, `img_in`, `final_layer.*`, `text_fusion.*.ff.*`); the
// ConvRot file stores the *reference* names (`blocks.N.attn.wq`, `qknorm.qnorm`, `mlp.gate`, `prenorm`,
// `tproj`, `first`, `last`, `tmlp`, `txtfusion.*.mlp.*`, `txtmlp`). So a ConvRot `Weights` translates
// every diffusers-key lookup to its native counterpart at read time — the DiT stays byte-for-byte the
// diffusers-key module tree, and only this remap + the int8 detect arm are ConvRot-aware.
//
// The map was validated exhaustively against the real 878-tensor header: all 430 diffusers keys map to
// a present native key, 224 of them to a quantized (`.weight_scale` sibling) projection, with no native
// key left uncovered (the format-spike remap, verified — see the sc-9300 PR).
//
// **Coherent as of sc-9601.** The remap + per-channel int8 loader (sc-9300) are correct but not enough:
// the stored int8 weight is the *rotated* `W·R` (dequantized `blocks.0.attn.wq` has cosine ≈ 0.07 with
// the canonical `to_q`), so reconstructing `X·Wᵀ` needs the matching **online activation rotation**
// `RHT(x)` — the regular-Hadamard (group 256) leg from arXiv 2512.03673 (clean-room from the paper +
// the `comfy_quant` descriptor). The ConvRot projection now applies it before the int8 IGEMM
// ([`crate::quant::ConvRotInt8`]), lifting the render from the sc-9300 NO-GO's noise (PSNR ≈ 8 dB) to
// coherent (verified cosine 0.99991 vs the f32 reference linear).
