//! The shared **packed-load** module (sc-9086, epic 9083) — the candle twin of
//! `mlx_gen::quant::{lin, embedding}` ([[the MLX Group-B template]], sc-8669). Every provider
//! crate's loader packed-**detects** with one call: a pre-quantized MLX tier (epic 8506, e.g.
//! `SceneWorks/z-image-turbo-mlx`) stores each quantized `Linear` / token embedding as the packed
//! triple `{base}.weight` (u32 codes) + `{base}.scales` + `{base}.biases`; [`lin`] / [`embedding`]
//! auto-detect it by the presence of `{base}.scales` (and/or the component `config.json`'s
//! `quantization: { bits, group_size }` block — [`PackedConfig`]) and build the quantized module
//! **directly from the packed parts** via the sc-9085 [`repack`] seam. Absent `.scales`, the dense
//! path is taken **unchanged**, so one loader serves both a dense bf16 and a pre-quantized snapshot.
//!
//! **The quantized forward dequantizes the weight into a *dense* matmul (sc-7702).** It does NOT
//! take candle's int8 `QMatMul` fast path (`fast_mmvq`/`fast_mmq`), which quantizes the *activation*
//! to per-32-element `q8_1`: a single outlier text feature (gpt-oss ±10⁴) sets a block's int8 scale
//! and zeros the co-located channels, so a Q4 denoise diverges to NaN — a solid-black render.
//! Dequantizing the weight to the activation dtype and running a plain matmul keeps the activation
//! full-precision, so uniform Q4 renders coherently. The resident footprint stays the small
//! quantized [`QTensor`]; the dequant is per-forward. This mirrors the Lens DiT quant (sc-5117) and
//! is regression-tested in `tests` (`q4_packed_forward_survives_outlier_activations`, CUDA-gated).
//!
//! **Idempotent [`QLinear::quantize`].** Crates call `quantize(bits)` after a dense load today; on a
//! QLinear that already loaded packed (`Quantized`) that call is a **no-op** — it does not
//! re-quantize (mirroring MLX's `AdaptableLinear::quantize` no-op-when-`Quantized`). So a loader can
//! packed-detect *and* keep an unconditional post-load `quantize` pass, and the two compose.
//!
//! **Bit-width, group size & repack.** MLX packs group-wise **affine** (`w = scale·q + bias`). The
//! z-image / flux tiers use group size 64, the default that the shape-inferring
//! [`repack::mlx_packed_bits`] and `lin`/`embedding`/`from_packed` assume; the boogu tier packs at
//! group **32** (sc-9410), which the shapes can't disambiguate, so its loaders pass the group size
//! explicitly (the `*_gs` entry points, read from `config.json`'s `quantization.group_size`,
//! [`PackedConfig`]). Q4 repacks **losslessly** into GGML `Q4_1` (same affine form; one MLX group of
//! `g` splits into `g / 32` `Q4_1` blocks). Q8 has no affine GGML container, so the Q8 tier is
//! materialized to its exact MLX grid and re-quantized to symmetric `Q8_0` (the accepted sc-9085
//! double-quant, 0.56 % mean relative RMS on the real z-image Q8 tier). See [`repack`] for the
//! byte-level details.
