# candle-gen

Rust-native generative image (and, later, video) model inference on
[candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) — the **Windows/CUDA sibling** of
[`mlx-gen`](../mlx-gen/README.md) (Apple MLX). Both crates implement the **same** backend-neutral
[`gen_core`](../../contracts/gen-core) contract (SceneWorks epic 3720), so a consumer selects one
named runtime bundle and calls the identical `Generator` / registry API regardless of which tensor
backend is underneath.

> **Status: a maturing multi-family engine on the Candle/CUDA lane.** candle-gen now hosts **20+
> cataloged model families** across image and video, plus a captioner, text/image embedders, and
> host-side conditioning utilities — every provider publishes an ordinary registration value that
> `candle-gen-catalog` composes explicitly, keeps the deterministic CPU-seeded-noise contract
> (launch-portable per seed), and rides the `CandleError → gen_core::Error` bridge. The families below
> are GPU-validated on an RTX PRO 6000 (Blackwell **sm_120**). The core `candle-gen` crate supplies the
> shared device/dtype seam, weight loaders, seeded noise, the unified sampler/scheduler framework (epic
> 7114), the LoRA/LoKr training + inference-merge harness, and the Q4/Q8 + MLX-packed quantization seam.

A provider crate publishes one or more named registration constants and a `register_providers`
builder function. `candle-gen-catalog` intentionally enumerates every family in the supported
Candle surface, making platform inclusion visible in review and exact-surface tests. Stable engine
ids are unchanged (e.g. `candle-gen-sdxl` exposes `"sdxl"`, which the SceneWorks worker maps both
`sdxl` and `realvisxl` onto), and every descriptor reports `backend: "candle"`.

## Backends / features

The default build is **CPU** (`candle-core`'s default) and works on macOS with no extra features.

| feature      | backend                | platform        | in `default`? |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| *(none)*     | CPU                    | all (Mac dev)   | yes           |
| `metal`      | Apple Metal GPU        | macOS           | no            |
| `cuda`       | NVIDIA CUDA            | Windows/Linux   | no            |

`cuda` needs the CUDA toolkit and **does not build on Mac**; all CUDA-only code is gated behind
`#[cfg(feature = "cuda")]`. A `flash-attn` feature used to exist as a no-op alias (`= ["cuda"]`,
forwarded crate-to-crate) that wired no fused kernels; it was removed in sc-9032. When the
`candle-flash-attn` slice is scheduled, reintroduce it behind real gated code, not a bare alias.

## Packaging (Windows / CUDA) — sc-3676

The goal is **one distributable CUDA worker that runs on every NVIDIA GPU we support, not just the
build box's Blackwell** — the "central fat binary, like torch" model.

### How portability works: PTX-JIT for dense kernels, a multi-arch fatbin for quantized kernels

candle-kernels has **two** compile paths, and they need different portability treatments (verified
against the vendored sources):

- **Dense kernels** build via cudaforge `.build_ptx()` → `nvcc --ptx`, emitting one **`compute_80`
  PTX** (virtual ISA) per kernel. The driver JIT-compiles that PTX to the runtime GPU's native SASS
  at first load, so it runs on **every NVIDIA arch ≥ sm_80** — Ampere (sm_80/86) → Ada (sm_89) →
  Hopper (sm_90) → Blackwell (sm_120) — from a single embedded PTX. (Tradeoff: it does not use
  sm_90a/sm_120a arch-accelerated tensor features, and the first run is slower while the driver JITs;
  the result caches per-GPU under `%APPDATA%\NVIDIA\ComputeCache`.)
- **Quantized + MoE kernels** (`mmq_gguf/*`, `moe/*`, `mmvq_gguf` — the GGUF `QMatMul`) build via
  cudaforge `.build_lib()` → `nvcc -c`: a **static `libmoe.a` of SASS, _not_ PTX**. cudaforge emits
  one `-gencode` from `CUDA_COMPUTE_CAP` (`GpuArch::parse` runs `parse::<usize>()` on the whole
  string, so a `;`-list does **not** parse — there is no multi-cap support). At the `=80` baseline the
  archive held only an **sm_80 cubin**; SASS is not forward-compatible across major arches and there
  is no PTX to JIT, so on **Blackwell sm_120 every quant matmul silently returned zeros** — dense
  models rendered but quantized models came out black (**sc-7544**; the dense PTX path masked it).

**The fix (sc-7544): a multi-arch fatbin for the quant path.** cudaforge can't emit a cap list and the
candle pin is upstream (not a fork), so candle-kernels is **locally forked** in `vendor/candle-kernels`
(identical to the pinned rev except three `-gencode` lines in `build.rs`) and patched in via the
workspace `[patch]`. nvcc accumulates `-gencode` flags, so `libmoe.a` becomes a real fatbin embedding
**sm_80 + sm_90 + sm_120 SASS + `compute_120` PTX** — one binary that runs natively Ampere → Ada →
Hopper → Blackwell and JITs forward to newer archs. Keep `CUDA_COMPUTE_CAP=80` in the recipes (it
seeds the sm_80 baseline for both paths). Verified on RTX PRO 6000 (sm_120): `cuobjdump --list-elf`
shows sm_80/sm_90/sm_120 cubin per kernel, and `candle-gen`'s `cuda_quant_smoke` test has the Q4/Q8
`QMatMul` matching the CPU reference (cos ≈ 1.0, vs cos ≈ 0 / all-zeros before). That smoke runs in
the CUDA gate so the regression can't return silently. **Re-vendor on every candle pin bump** — see
`vendor/candle-kernels/VENDORED.md`.

### Build

Build-time needs the **CUDA 12.9 toolkit (nvcc)** + **VS 2022 v143 (MSVC 14.4x) Build Tools**; the
build is driven through `vcvars64.bat`. From a `cmd` shell that has sourced vcvars:

```bat
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
set CUDA_COMPUTE_CAP=80
set "CUDA_PATH=C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v12.9"
cargo build --release -p candle-gen-sdxl --example sdxl-txt2img --features cuda
```

The scripted, reproducible form of this — sources vcvars, sets the env, runs `cargo build/test
--workspace --features cuda` — is `scripts/check-cuda.ps1`. **Run it before pushing CUDA-touching
changes**: the CPU/Metal CI lanes are blind to `#[cfg(feature = "cuda")]` code, so this is the real
cuda gate.

```powershell
pwsh scripts/check-cuda.ps1            # build + test
pwsh scripts/check-cuda.ps1 -SkipTests # build-only smoke check
```

The `windows-cuda` lane in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same recipe but is **manual-only**
(`workflow_dispatch`) — it needs no standing runner. To run it in CI you must first register a
self-hosted `[self-hosted, windows, cuda]` runner, then dispatch the workflow by hand. (GitHub's
hosted GPU larger-runners are Tesla T4 / sm_75, below our sm_80 baseline, so they can't run it.)

### Bundle the runtime DLLs

The target machine needs the CUDA **runtime** libraries but should **not** require a CUDA Toolkit
install. `scripts/package-cuda.ps1` copies the binary plus the redistributable DLLs (which cudarc
dynamic-links, resolved from the exe's own directory) into `dist/`:

```powershell
pwsh scripts/package-cuda.ps1 -BinaryPath target\release\examples\sdxl-txt2img.exe
```

Bundled redist DLLs (CUDA 12.9; the script globs the version suffixes):

| DLL                          | provides            |
|------------------------------|---------------------|
| `cudart64_12.dll`            | CUDA runtime        |
| `cublas64_12.dll`            | cuBLAS              |
| `cublasLt64_12.dll`          | cuBLAS-Lt           |
| `curand64_10.dll`            | cuRAND              |
| `nvrtc64_120_0.dll`          | NVRTC               |
| `nvrtc-builtins64_129.dll`   | NVRTC builtins      |

The script also writes a `RUNTIME.txt` manifest into the bundle. Verified: with the bundle's DLLs
present and the **CUDA toolkit removed from `PATH`**, the binary runs end-to-end (DLLs resolve from
the exe's directory).

### Minimum driver

The **NVIDIA driver is not bundled** (it is not redistributable) and is what JIT-compiles the PTX +
provides `libcuda`. For the bundled **CUDA 12.9** runtime the floor is:

- **Windows: driver ≥ 576.02** (CUDA 12.9 GA).
- GPU compute capability **≥ 8.0** (Ampere / RTX 30-series or newer).

Older drivers should be updated from nvidia.com; the CUDA runtime DLLs in the bundle do **not** lift
the driver requirement.

## gen-core pinning (read before bumping)

`sceneworks-gen-core` is a path dependency in the canonical workspace and must resolve exactly once
in every product graph. Two releases silently create two contract type identities and two copies of
host policy; explicit registries prevent hidden discovery, but duplicated contracts remain an
unsupported and drift-prone graph. Run the gate:

```bash
bash scripts/check-gen-core-skew.sh            # checks candle-gen's build graph
bash scripts/check-gen-core-skew.sh --self-test  # proves the gate fires on canned skew
```

When bumping the gen-core pin, bump it in lockstep with the worker's `mlx-gen` + `sceneworks-gen-core`
pins.

## Develop

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo check --workspace                 # CPU (Mac default)
cargo check --workspace --features metal  # Metal backend builds
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace                  # registry-resolution + bridge tests
```

The candle version this workspace settled on is recorded in `[workspace.dependencies]`
(`candle-core` / `candle-nn`).
