# sc-4482 (epic 3720): version-skew guard for the backend-neutral gen-core contract.
#
# THE TRAP: everything is git-SHA-pinned. If `mlx-gen` (macOS) resolves `sceneworks-gen-core`
# at rev A while the worker's direct dep resolves rev B, cargo silently builds BOTH. The
# provider crates expose rev A's contract types while the worker composes rev B's. Depending on the
# graph shape this produces incompatible registry values, duplicate policy implementations, or
# behavior drift hidden behind otherwise-identical package names.
#
# This gate fails the build if more than one distinct `sceneworks-gen-core` resolution exists in
# the root package's dependency graph. It is reusable: pass the root package as $1 (default
# `sceneworks-worker`); the candle-gen repo wires this same script against its own worker package
# (epic 3672). `--target all` is REQUIRED so the macOS-only `mlx-gen` transitive gen-core is
# resolved even when this runs on a Linux CI lane (otherwise the skew is invisible off-macOS).
#
# Self-test: `check-gen-core-skew.sh --self-test` exercises the verdict logic on canned input
# (one-resolution => pass, two-resolutions => fail) so CI proves the gate actually fires without
# needing a deliberately-broken pin checked in.

Two gen-core revs => two contract type identities and two copies of host policy in one product
graph. Explicit registries prevent silent provider discovery, but they do not make duplicated
contracts a supported configuration. Align the runtime release and any direct contract edge so
every provider and consumer resolves the same `sceneworks-gen-core` package.

# `--color never` overrides CI's `CARGO_TERM_COLOR=always` (which would otherwise wrap the ` (*)`

# sc-9022 (F-038): run `cargo tree` on its own and capture stdout, stderr, and exit code
# SEPARATELY. Previously this was `cargo tree … 2>/dev/null | sed | … | evaluate`, which discarded
# cargo's stderr AND let the pipeline's exit status come from `evaluate` (the last stage). So a
# genuine RESOLUTION failure (network/fetch, auth, a bad or unknown pin, unknown package) produced
# zero matching lines, and `evaluate` mis-reported "${CRATE} was not found in the build graph" — the
# WRONG diagnosis, sending developers to hunt for pin skew when cargo could not resolve the graph at
# all. Now a nonzero `cargo tree` exit is surfaced with cargo's own stderr and a distinct message,
# and only successful output is fed into the skew verdict.
#
# NOTE on `set -e`: a failing command substitution in a plain assignment (`var=$(cmd)`) DOES abort
# under `set -euo pipefail` when the script runs from a file, so we can't just read `$?` afterwards
# — the script would exit first with cargo's raw code and NONE of the diagnostics below. We disable
# errexit only for the capture, record the exit code, then restore it.
